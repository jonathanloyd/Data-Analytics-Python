The majority of the functionality for this assignment is in hw2.ipynb. All of the code can be ran in sequential order from top to bottom to assess the correctness of the assignment. Using "Run All" under the "Cell" tab or "Restart & Run All" under the "Kernel" tab should be sufficient.

For part a, the book, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was chosen to analyze. The file for the book is alice.txt. For part b, I try to substitute spaces for the special characters, and then use the variable "word_list" to store the list of words. To print this variable, simply uncomment out the line "# print(word_list)". For part c, the dataframe is assigned to the variable df. For part d, the dataframe is assigned to the variable df2. Finally, for part e, the list of dataframes for each chapters is called dataframe_list, and this is printed out with the corresponding chapter in the last cell.
